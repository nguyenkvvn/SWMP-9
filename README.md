## Description
This is a 3D printable frame for the M&P series pistol.
It is compatible with the 1.0 M&P 9, 9L, and 9C.
It is untested with 2.0 M&P 9's, 1.0/2.0 .40's, or 1.0/2.0 .357's.
This frame is NOT compatible with the M&P 9 Shield, as that is a different frame size entirely.
This frame is NOT compatible with 1.0/2.0 45's, as they utlize a different locking block.
Variants provided include texturing and rails.
Note that aftermarket triggers _and Performance Center_ triggers may require modification to the striker plate interface loop towards the rear.

- **SWMP-9C** - Compact length grip, with compact length slide. (Matches factory 1.0 M&P 9C offering.)
- **SWMP-9X** - Standard length grip, with compact length slide. (Think Glock 19X.)

- **MMMMandP** - Standard length ergonomizied grip, with standard length slide. A race-gun style vairant with an integral gas pedal, extended beaver tail, grip texturing, and semi-flared magwell.

If you have a M&P _9L_ kit, you can use any frame with the standard length slide. Each frame also has a textured variant, railed variant, and a texture + rail variant.

## Materials Required
You will need a set of each below for each [x] you make.
- x1 **Parts Kit** - Procure a parts kit of your preference.
- x1 **Glock Steel Spring** - this is for retainign the magazine release button
- x1 **Magazine** - You will need a magazine for your respective caliber and frame size. (Remember- compact magazines do not fit with full-size magazines. If you are in a pinch, P229 magazines will fit inside a compact length grip.)

## Instructions
1. Print the frame at your best printing strength and quality. 100% infill is required, and tree supports definitely help. Print with the frame standing up, with the top of the frame parallel with the print bed, standing up.
2. Insert the rear fire control group module into the frame. You may need a ball and peen hammer to gently tap the module into place. Remember- it insert at an angle into the frame, so don't force it downwards if it doesn't seat. Remove and try again. It must seat completely into the bottom of the slot.
3. Pin the rear fire control group into place.
4. Insert the trigger assembly into the frame, with the sear-lifter of the trigger bar into place of the rear fire control group module.
5. Insert the slide release part so that the hole pin is in-line with the trigger's hole pin, as well as the frame's hole pin.
6. Press and insert the front locking block down into the frame. Ensure that the locking block is down entirely, and the holes are visible through the side of the frame without any obstruction.
7. Pin in the front locking block.
8. Using the trigger pin, insert the non-flared face of the pin into the RIGHT of the frame, and punch the pin through, ensuring it goes through the slide lock, trigger shoe, **as well as trigger return spring**. (Be careful not to damage the plastic trigger shoe.)
9. TEST that the trigger and trigger return spring function. Pulling forward on the trigger should lower the striker sear. Ensure that when the trigger is pulled, moving the trigger bar to the right disconnects it from the striker sear.
10. TEST the slide release has tension and can re-seat into place.
11. Using a pair of flush cutters, make a small 2mm snip on the LEFT-HAND side of the frame at the magazine release button slot if you are right-handed, and vice-versa if you are left-handed. This will be where you insert the button.
12. Insert the button, and then thread through the magazine release spring from the bottom of the mag well
13. TEST and ensure magazine retention and function.
14. Insert locking lug into the front locking block. Be sure the locking lug is in the "disassembly position."
15. Insert the slide onto the assembly and set the locking lug to "locked".
16. TEST: Perform full function check of gun. (All testing steps thus far.)

Pro-tip: Using a vice is okay to press the pins in place.
