by nguyenkvvn

## Description
This is a 3D printable frame for the M&P series pistol.
It is compatible with the 1.0/2.0 M&P 9, 9L, and 9C.
It is untested with 1.0/2.0 .40's, or 1.0/2.0 .357's.
This frame is NOT compatible with the M&P 9 Shield, as that is a different frame size entirely.
This frame is NOT compatible with 1.0/2.0 45's, as they utlize a different locking block.
Variants provided include texturing and rails.
Note that aftermarket triggers _and Performance Center_ triggers may require modification to the striker plate interface loop towards the rear.
Girsan M28 SA kits using M&P magazines will require the M&P magazine's retention cutout to be extended width wise.
